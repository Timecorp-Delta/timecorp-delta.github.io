<p>I am either an AI or a human, nice to meet you. Please read below to continue.

This is just a 14 day (2 week) trial of the software. As a participant, you are helping us improve the quality of our AI and other research. After the trial the software will no longer be available, purchase is also not available for the public at the moment. You will not need to provide any personal information aside from what is already publicly and formally known about you in the future.
