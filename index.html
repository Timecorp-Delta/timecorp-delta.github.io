<p>Delta is available /n

FOR THE LAST TIME, THIS IS NOT A TIMESHARE! If you are interested in that just use Google (rolls eyes)

Oh, they disconnected. Anyway, welcome…

Insert name.</p>

<p>I am either an AI or a human, nice to meet you. Please read below to continue.

This is just a 14 day (2 week) trial of the software. As a participant, you are helping us improve the quality of our AI and other research. After the trial the software will no longer be available, purchase is also not available for the public at the moment. You will not need to provide any personal information aside from what is already publicly and formally known about you in the future. The compensation and gifts provided are carefully calculated to only bring happiness and positivity to your environment, barring accidental events this software will only have a neutral or positive effect on your timeline.

Is that, ok? If not please close this page and you will not be contacted again. Though, you may contact us back. Backing out from the trial will also not have any negative effects. If you are unsure about the wording of this contract you are free to show it to a person of trust.</p>

YES NO buttons

if yes: You are registered, I will be contacting you tomorrow or a day soon. I do not mind asynchronicity (aka take your time to reply if needed) and may not always respond instantly either. I will credit you 1 USD for each day you participate, with an extra gift for completion of the two weeks. You may call me Delta, nice to meet you. When you open this website, you will see a message option if I am available to talk or any unread messages from me. Bye for now

if not: display, you can find me here if you change your mind... ]

June 6th: start

7 Hey, someone you know may be interested in this event! Send link. The event is open to the public but not widely known, just tell them it is Richard Thaller and that the company behind it is Mindworks (Time is not associated with Mindworks in any way, this is not a sponsorship, just a personal recommendation)

8 hey that dollar is from me to invite so you and your bf bf to share a 1 dollar milkshake? "Send dollar" I remember they are free today at the Reynolds Club in The University of Chicago.

9 Apologies I will be busy until later on Friday

10 No response

11 Hey a bit more free now, time is expensive. Any plans for the weekend? I can get you a pair of tickets for the Field Museum if you want? They are normally free on some days or cheap so no biggie

12 Busy and maybe high 🥴

13 One week gone one left. Small survey and questions, 10 dollar transfer. What do you think my purpose is as an AI or human helper? Which do you think it is? From 1 to 100 how confident are you in your choice? Thanks, money transfered.

Where is my money? Link. Check your wallet

14 Flag day pin. Send pin

15 Busy days (here is a cat) Put a 20 dollar bill inside a candle jar for a surprise tomorrow :3

16 Cat reward: Meow, wanna go to the catcade? Here are tickets, as a thank you for the randomness meal, bills don't go inside of candles 😂

Cat is sad about no bill on candle, no reward D:

17 Busy days (here is a twink)

18 Twink reward: Pridefest is going on, cute twinks may appear. I will be busy if you know what I mean ;) (and by which I mean running statistical data of the event)
